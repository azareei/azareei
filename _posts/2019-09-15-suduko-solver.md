<br>


<p>
The following code finds a solution to the Sudoku puzzle using recursive methods. If multiple solution exists, this code only finds one of the solutions that needs less computation. You can tweak the code to find all of the solutions. You can find this on my <a href="https://github.com/ahmadzareei/Sudoku">github</a>.
