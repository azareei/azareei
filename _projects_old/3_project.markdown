Internal waves occur in the
interior of a fluid and are caused by density stratification. A
slight change in liquid density, which occurs often in the ocean,
causes significantly large internal waves.  Moreover, internal
waves play an essential role in weather condition, mixing, and
circulation in the ocean through their breaking.  The energy
transport mechanism is currently not well understood.  In my prior
research, we identified a second-harmonic instability mechanism
which describes the transfer of internal wave energy to higher
frequencies. This instability offers a new potential mechanism for
energy transfer to higher modes that results in wave breaking. We
furthermore characterized the way in which internal waves in ocean
interact with the sea-bed through Bragg resonance which
potentially explains experimentally observed areas of high-mixing
within the ocean.
