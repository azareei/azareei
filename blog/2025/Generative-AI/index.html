  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A generative model is a <em>joint</em> probability distribution $p(x)$, for $x\in\mathcal{X}$ . It’s a joint distribution because $x$ can be multidimensional where it consists of multiple variables  $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$.</p>

<p>We also have <em>conditional</em> generative model $p(x\vert c)$ in which the generative model would be conditioned on inputs or covariates $c\in C$.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-generative-models">Types of generative Models</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Probabilistic graphical models (PGM):</strong> uses simple, often linear, mappings to map a set of interconnected latent variables $z_1, \ldots, z_L$ to observed variables $x_1, \ldots, x_D$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Deep Generative Models (DGM):</strong> uses deep neural networks to learn a complex mapping from a single latent vector $z$ to the observed data $x$. Types of DGM are
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAE)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>AutoRegressive Models (ARM) models</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Normalizing Flows</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Diffusion Models</strong></li>

<h2 id="goals-of-generative-ai">Goals of Generative AI</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Data Generation</strong>: One of the primary goals of generative AI is <strong>data generation</strong>, where models create new data samples that resemble the original data they were trained on. This includes generating realistic images, text, audio, or other forms of data. Generative AI is also used for various tasks, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Creating synthetic data</strong> for training discriminative models.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Conditional generation</strong> to control outputs based on specific inputs, enabling applications such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Text-to-image (e.g., generating an image from a text description).</li>
          <li>Image-to-text (e.g., image captioning).</li>
          <li>Image-to-image (e.g., colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and restoration).</li>
          <li>Speech-to-text (e.g., automatic speech recognition or ASR).</li>
          <li>Sequence-to-sequence (e.g., machine translation or text continuation).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The difference between conditional generative models and discriminative models lies in the outputs: generative models allow multiple valid outputs, whereas discriminative models assume a single correct output.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Density estimation</strong>: Generative models are useful for calculating the probability of observed data, $p(x)$, which is known as density function. This has applications in: 
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Outlier detection</strong>: Identifying data points with low probability under the estimated distribution, which may indicate anomalies or rare events. </li>
      <li>
<strong>Data compression</strong>: Using the probability distribution to represent data more efficiently by assigning shorter codes to more likely outcomes.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Generative classification</strong>: Classifying data by estimating class-conditional densities $p(x\vert c)$ and combining them with prior probabilities to make decisions.</li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Model comparison</strong>: Evaluating and comparing different models by analyzing how well they represent the observed data distribution.</p>

        <p>Simple methods like kernel density estimation (KDE) are effective in low dimensions, using kernels (e.g., uniform or Gaussian) to estimate $p(x\vert \mathcal{D})$ based on observed data $\mathcal{D}$. However, KDE faces challenges in high dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality, requiring the use of parametric models  $p_\theta(x)$ for efficient and scalable density estimation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Missing Data Imputation</strong>: missing values in a dataset are filled in using probabilistic methods. For example, a simple approach like mean value imputation replaces missing values with the average of observed values for each feature but ignores dependencies between variables. A more advanced method involves fitting a generative model to the observed data  $p(X_o)$ and sampling missing values conditioned on the observed data $p(X_m \vert X_o)$. This approach, called multiple imputation, can handle complex data types, such as filling in missing pixels in images (in-painting). Generative models provide a more robust solution by capturing variable dependencies and offering uncertainty estimates for the imputed values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Structure Discovery</strong>: Generative models with latent variables can uncover hidden patterns or structures in data by inferring the latent causes $z$ that generate observed data $x$ using Bayes’ rule $p(z\vert x) \propto p(z)p(x\vert z)$. For example, in social network analysis, a generative model can represent each user’s behavior and interactions using latent variables $z$  that correspond to hidden community memberships or shared interests. By applying Bayes’ rule, the model can infer these latent communities $z$ from observed interaction patterns $x$, revealing the underlying structure of the network and grouping users with similar behaviors or preferences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> <strong>Latent Space Interpolation</strong>: Generative models with latent variable representations enable <strong>latent space interpolation</strong>, where new data is generated by smoothly blending features between existing data points. For example, given two images, their latent encodings $z_1$ and$ z_2$ can serve as anchors in the latent space. By interpolating linearly between these encodings $z = \lambda z_1 + (1-\lambda)z_2$ and decoding the results, the model generates images combining characteristics of both inputs, such as transitioning between two digits or blending facial attributes. Additionally, <strong>latent space arithmetic</strong> allows modifying specific attributes. For example, in a model trained on celebrity faces, adding a learned offset vector for “sunglasses” to a latent encoding can generate a version of the face with sunglasses, while subtracting the vector can remove them. These techniques make latent spaces powerful for generating and manipulating data with meaningful variations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Generative Design</strong>: Generative models are used to explore designs with specific properties. For example, in material science, a model trained on molecular data can generate new chemical structures optimized for properties like higher conductivity or stability by searching the latent space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Generative models simulate environments, such as robotics tasks, enabling agents to practice and plan in virtual settings, reducing reliance on expensive real-world data collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Representation Learning</strong>: Generative models learn compact latent representations $z$ that capture the underlying structure of data. For example, a model trained on medical images can extract features like the presence of tumors, which can then be used for tasks like diagnosis or prediction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Data Compression</strong>: Generative models predict the probability of data patterns and assign shorter codes to frequent patterns, enabling efficient storage and transmission of data, as described by Shannon’s information theory.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="evaluating-generative-models">Evaluating generative models</h2>

<p>The generative AI models are evaluated on three aspects</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Sample Quality</strong>: Do the generated examples look realistic and belong to the same type of data as the training set?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Sample Diversity</strong>: Do the generated examples represent all the different variations present in the real data?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Generalization</strong>: Can the model create new examples that go beyond simply memorizing the training data?</li>
</ol>

<p>No single metric captures all above, we use different metrics for each or combine parts.</p>

<h3 id="likelihood-based-evaluation">Likelihood-based evaluation</h3>
<p>To evaluate how well a generative model $q$ matches the true data distribution $p$, <strong>KL Divergence</strong> is a commonly used metric:</p>

\[D_{KL}(p \parallel q) = \int p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx = \int p(x) \log p(x) \, dx - \int p(x) \log q(x) \, dx = - H(p) + H_{ce}(p, q)\]

<p>The $D_{KL}$ measures the <em>distance</em> between the two distributions. Smaller value indicates that the model closely approximates the true data distribution. The first term on the RHS is the <strong>entropy</strong> of $p(x)$, denoted as H(p). Since $H(p)$ depends only on the true distribution $p(x)$, it is a constant when evaluating the model $q(x)$. The second term is the <strong>cross-entropy</strong> between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, denoted as $H_{ce}(p, q)$.</p>

<p>Minimizing $D_{KL}(p \parallel q)$ is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy $H_{ce}(p, q)$ (remember entropy term is constant and does not depend on $q$).</p>

<p>Approximating $p(x)$ with the empirical data distribution represented by a finite dataset ${x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N}$, then $p(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \delta (x-x_i)$, where $x_i$ is the $i$th observed data, and $\delta(.)$ is the Dirac’s delta function, then the cross-entropy becomes:</p>

\[H_{ce}(p, q) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \log q(x_n)\]

<p>This is known as the <strong>Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)</strong>.</p>

\[\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \log q(x_n)\]

<p>Key Insights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>*NLL and Cross-Entropy</strong>: The NLL represents the average penalty for the model q(x) assigning probabilities to observed data points in a dataset.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Test Set Evaluation</strong>: NLL is typically computed on a held-out test set to measure the model’s generalization ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Entropy</strong> $H(p)$: Since entropy is a constant with respect to the model $q(x)$, it does not affect optimization when training the model.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="nll-and-perplexity">NLL and perplexity</h4>

<p>For models of discrete data, such as language models, <strong>Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)</strong> is a straightforward way to measure how well the model predicts the data. NLL evaluates the average “surprise” the model experiences when it encounters the actual outcomes in the dataset, based on the probabilities it assigns to them. The term “surprise” refers to how unexpected an event is, given the model’s prediction. If the model assigns a high probability to the correct outcome, the surprise (and NLL) is low. Conversely, if the model assigns a low probability, the surprise is high, reflecting the model’s uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>*Example:</strong>	
 Suppose a language model predicts the next word in the sentence “The cat sat on the __” with the following probabilities:</p>

    <p>• $q(\text{“mat”}) = 0.6$,
 • $q(\text{“floor”}) = 0.3$,
 • $q(\text{“table”}) = 0.1.$</p>

    <p>If the correct word is “mat,” the NLL for this prediction is simply:</p>

\[\text{NLL} = -\log_2(q(\text{“mat”})) = -\log_2(0.6) \approx 0.737\]

    <p>The NLL for a dataset averages these values across all predictions, measuring how well the model predicts the actual words.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Interpreting NLL directly can be unintuitive. To make it easier to understand, <strong>perplexity</strong> is used. Perplexity translates NLL into a measure that reflects how “confused” the model is—essentially, the average number of equally likely choices the model is effectively guessing from.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>*Why Does Perplexity Represent Choices?</strong>: If a model has a perplexity of $P$, it behaves as if it is guessing from $P$ equally likely options. This comes from the relationship between NLL and uniform distributions: for $P$ equally likely outcomes, $q(x) = 1/P$, and the NLL is:</p>

\[\text{NLL} = -\log_2(1/P) = \log_2(P)\]

    <p>Inverting this gives $P = 2^{\text{NLL}}$.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mathematically, perplexity is defined as:
  \(\text{Perplexity} = 2^H\)</p>

<p>where $H = \text{NLL}$. Lower perplexity indicates better performance, as the model is less “confused” and more confident in its predictions.</p>
